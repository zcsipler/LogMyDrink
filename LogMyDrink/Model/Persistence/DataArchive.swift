import Foundation

/// Everything the app knows, in a form that survives outside it.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// CloudKit (11.4) covers the ordinary case: same Apple ID, new phone, the data
/// is already there. It does not cover the rest, and the rest is not exotic.
///
/// - **iCloud is not a backup.** A user who clears the app's iCloud data in
///   Settings has cleared it everywhere. There is no bin to recover from.
/// - **Not everyone syncs.** Signed out of iCloud, or iCloud Drive off, and the
///   local fallback in `LogMyDrinkApp.makeContainer` is the whole story. For
///   those users this file is the only way to move anything.
/// - **Apple ID changes happen**, and CloudKit has nothing to say about them.
/// - **A migration can go wrong**, and a CloudKit schema cannot be rolled back
///   once it is deployed to production — only extended.
/// - **Portability** (GDPR art. 20). For a record of someone's drinking, being
///   able to take it away is not a formality.
///
/// ## Why JSON and not a copy of the store
///
/// Copying the `.sqlite` is tempting and wrong: it carries SwiftData and
/// CloudKit bookkeeping, and nothing guarantees a future version can open it.
/// JSON is readable, diffable, and carries its own version.
///
/// ## What is in it, and what is not
///
/// The same principle as the session snapshot (5.5): **the input is stored, not
/// the curve.** Drinks and the profile they were recorded against are enough to
/// redraw everything, and a later improvement to the engine then applies to
/// imported history as well.
///
/// So the cached summary — `cachedPeakLow`, `cachedSoberAt`,
/// `cachedEngineVersion` and the rest — is deliberately absent. It is
/// recomputable, it is tied to `BACEngine.version`, and carried into a build
/// with a different engine it would state figures that build never produced.
/// `AppSettings` is absent for a different reason: it describes the device, not
/// the person (see its own note).
