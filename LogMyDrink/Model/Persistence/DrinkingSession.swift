/// One drinking occasion, from the first drink until the level has cleared.
///
/// A session is **not** a calendar day: an evening that runs past midnight is
/// one session.
///
/// ## Why the profile is stored here
///
/// The curve is a pure function of (drinks, profile). If we kept only the
/// drinks and always recomputed with the *current* profile, every past session
/// would be redrawn whenever the user's weight changed — the same three drinks
/// peak at 0.578 g/L at 60 kg and 0.507 g/L at 70 kg, a 14 % difference. A
/// record that rewrites itself is not a record.
///
/// So each session carries the profile that was in effect. A closed session is
/// frozen; an open one tracks the current profile until it closes, because a
/// correction made mid-evening should fix the curve you are looking at.
///
/// The engine is deliberately *not* frozen: the inputs are stored, so a later
/// improvement to the model can recompute old sessions correctly.
///
/// ## CloudKit constraints
///
/// Every property has a default value or is optional, there are no unique
/// attributes, and the relationship is optional with an inverse. CloudKit
/// requires all of this, and retrofitting it later means a migration.
