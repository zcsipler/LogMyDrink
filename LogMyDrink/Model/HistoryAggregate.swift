///   bump), the peak is simply missing rather than computed on the spot.
///   `HistoryOccasion.peakRange` is optional for exactly this reason, and every
///   bucket says whether its peak is complete.
/// - **"Did not drink" and "do not know" are different (5.7).** A day before
///   the person's `trackingStartedAt` is `.unknown`; an empty day after it is
///   `.dry`. Dry days are counted, unknown days are not.
