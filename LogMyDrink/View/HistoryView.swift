///
/// One screen, not a list and a separate statistics page. A segment picker
/// sets how much calendar is on screen, chevrons page it back and forth, the
/// chart shows one bar per day (or per month), and the sessions of that span
/// sit underneath as rows — tapping one opens its curve, drawn with that
/// session's own profile snapshot (5.5). Tapping a bar shows its value; the
/// segment only ever changes from the picker.
///
/// The trend segment is different in kind: no pages, no rows, the whole
/// recorded span on two scrolling, pinch-zoomable curves (`HistoryTrend`),
/// with the figures card covering everything ever recorded.
///
/// The free window is the first page of the week view: the last seven
/// drinking days, today included. Everything behind it — older pages, the
/// month and year views, and the reading on rows older than seven days — is
/// shown blurred with a lock, so a free user sees what is there and not just
/// that something is. `FeatureFlags.canShowHistory` is the one rule; the data
/// underneath is recorded for everyone.
