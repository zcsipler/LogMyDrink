import SwiftUI

/// A blood alcohol figure.
///
/// Every headline figure in the app goes through here, so what the app claims
/// about its own precision is decided in one place.
///
/// ## One number or a range
///
/// Both, and the user picks which. The view always takes the band; it prints a
/// single number when the band has no width and a range when it has. Nothing
/// here decides the question — `betaUncertainty` does, from the profile.
///
/// The default is zero, so the app opens showing single numbers. The reason is
/// what the figure is *for*: a personal reference scale you learn over time —
/// what 0.6 feels like for you. A range has no fixed point for that memory to
/// attach to. The uncertainty is also **systematic per person, not random
/// noise**: if your true rate is 0.18 and the app assumes 0.15, every figure is
/// off in the same direction by about the same amount, and a consistent bias is
/// harmless for a scale you calibrate yourself against.
///
/// Turning the uncertainty up is a deliberate step into the other mode, where
/// the app stops asserting a point and reports the spread instead. That is the
/// honest reading of what the model knows, and it is worth offering — it is
/// just not the right thing to hand someone on first launch.
///
/// The spread is shown regardless where it changes what you would do: the
/// clearing **time**, where it can mean four hours, and the band on the chart,
/// which says "this is a model" without any number becoming fuzzy.
