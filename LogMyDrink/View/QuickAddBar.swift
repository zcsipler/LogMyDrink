/// The floating controls at the bottom of the Live screen.
///
/// Two capsules, not one split in half. "Add drink" stays exactly what it was,
/// and the quick add sits next to it as its own thing — a shortcut that is
/// visibly a second button rather than an edge of the first one. Both at thumb
/// height, for the reason the single capsule always was: this happens
/// one-handed, in a bar.
///
/// The quick capsule is on the **right**. It is the more frequent of the two
/// and the right side is the shorter reach for a right-handed thumb; it is also
/// the one that carries colour, so it reads as the primary action wherever the
/// eye lands first.
///
/// ## Why the projected peak is on the button
///
/// The app exists because the decision is made *before* the drink is poured,
/// and a forward simulation is what intervenes there (2., 5.10). A one-tap add
/// would ordinarily remove that intervention and leave a retrospective unit
/// counter, which is the thing the product is explicitly not.
///
/// Printing the projected peak on the button keeps it. The figure is under the
/// thumb at the moment of pressing, and the fill is the level colour for that
/// peak — the same tint the sheet's Add button already uses, so a drink that
/// would cross the limit turns the control red before it is pressed rather than
/// after.
///
/// **Always a single number**, even when the readout elsewhere is showing a
/// range (5.8). A range is about twice as wide, and a capsule whose width
/// depends on an unrelated setting is a capsule that eventually truncates.
///
/// ## Why the figure is not on the quick capsule
///
/// It was, twice: first as a bare `+ 1.94 ‰`, which told a first-time reader
/// neither what would be added nor what the number meant, and then on a second
/// line under the drink's name, labelled. The second version was readable and
/// still wrong, because everything had to shrink to fit — and the one moment
/// this button exists for is the moment its reader is least able to read small
/// text.
///
/// So the capsule says what it would add, in the largest type that fits, and
/// nothing else. **The colour carries the projection.** That is not a
/// concession: `Theme.tint` is anchored to this person's own limit (5.14), so
/// full red lands exactly on the line they drew, and "would this take me over"
/// is answered continuously, before the press, at a glance. What the figure has
/// that the colour does not is resolution — and nobody needs to tell 0.44 from
/// 0.47 while deciding on the next pint. The exact number is on screen a second
/// later, in the strip and on the readout above.
///
/// The one thing the colour cannot do is reach someone who cannot see it, so
/// the limit warning is repeated as a glyph — the same three-state vocabulary
/// the sheet uses (5.2), and readable in conditions where a number is not.
