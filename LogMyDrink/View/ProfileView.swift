// Two reasons, and both are measured or evident rather than assumed. Writing to

// UserDefaults, and for the profile it also re-runs `simulateBand` — three RK4
// integrations, 2.5–6 ms depending on how many drinks are in the session, which
// is a large part of a 120 Hz frame. On top of that, a value read from the
// store invalidates whoever read it: with these controls inlined in
// `ProfileView` that was the whole `Form`, six sections including the
// elimination explainer's eight interpolated, localized strings.
//
// Holding the draft locally means a drag re-renders one row and touches
// nothing else. The store is written once, on release. Anything that has to
// move *with* the value therefore lives inside the row that owns the draft —
// which is why the explainer moved here with its slider rather than staying
// behind in `ProfileView`.
